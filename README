# libdyntree

:tree: A dynamic n-ary tree to store recursive structures, key-value stores and single fields in a fast and comprehensive C datastructure.

## How to build

libdyntree is built with cmake. It has no external dependencies and compilation has been tested with gcc 6+ on Linx systems. It was tested with C11 but should be able to run on C99 or older.

```console
$> mkdir build; cd build
$> cmake ..
$> make -j 2
```

This will create a `.a` file. If you require a shared object, you can change the linking behaviour in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.


## How to use

Using libdyntree is straighforward with a comprehensive API. Everything resolves around `dtree` objects and providing fields to API functions. Every function is documented as outlined in the header files.
