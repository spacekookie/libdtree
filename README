The last C datastructure library you will use. Provides a versatile
structure that can act as lists, sets and more!


How to build
------------

An out-of-source build is recommended.

```
$> mkdir build; cd build
$> cmake ..
$> make -j 2
```

This will create a `.so` file. If you require a static object, you can
change the linking behaviour in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.
